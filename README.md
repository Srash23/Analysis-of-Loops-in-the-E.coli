This study provides an in-depth analysis of loops within the E. coli transcription factor network using Python libraries NetworkX and matplotlib. By constructing and visualizing the network, we examined the prevalence and distribution of loops, revealing a complex structure with significant self-loops indicative of feedback mechanisms. The analysis encompassed 197 transcription factors and approximately 477 regulatory interactions, highlighting the network's regulatory intricacies. Our findings enhance the understanding of transcriptional regulation in E. coli and demonstrate the effectiveness of computational tools in biological network analysis.
